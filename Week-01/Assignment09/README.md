# Store Web Page

### Task

Create a complete webpage that includes everything we learned previously.

We have a store, and we want to write the store’s title at the top of the page. Use the correct HTML element for the title.

Under the title, there is a text paragraph describing the store. Write it below the title using the correct element.

Inside the store, there are two product sections. Write a heading for each section, and you are free to choose any title you like.

Under each section title, add 3 products, and each product should have a title and a text paragraph.

After each product, separate them with a horizontal line.
